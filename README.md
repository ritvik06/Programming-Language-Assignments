# Programming Laguages Assignments

Assignments completed while pursuing the course programming languages.

## Assignments

0.  ***Big Integer*** **Package (BigInt)** <br>
    [More](./Assignment%200/README.md)
    - Creating a big-int package, to be used in further assignments.
    - Allows us to carry out various mathematical operations for large integers.
1.  _A simple_ **definitional interpreter** _and_ **stack machine** <br>
    [More](./Assignment%201/README.md)
    - Model the "abstract syntax" of a simple calculator language for big_integer expressions, and give it "semantic meaning", and give it "semantic meaning"
    - Implement the calculator as a simple stack-based machine, using opcodes into which the abstract syntax of an expression is compiled.
2. _Building a_ ***scanner*** _using OCaml-Lex_ <br>
    [More](./Assignment%202/README.md)
    - Specify the tokens for a simple arithmetic and boolean calculation language.
    - Generate a scanner for the defined tokens.
3. _Parsing for a simple expression evaluator_ <br>
    [More](./Assignment%203/README.md)
    - Design a grammar for a simple expression language, taking care to enforce precedence rules (e.g., BODMAS).
    - Generate an abstract syntax tree from the parsed data. Then, use it for further evaluation.
3. _Implement a type checker for our evaluator_ <br>
    [More](./Assignment%204/README.md)
    - Extend our language to support types. Set operational limits wiht respect to types.
    - Set up a type checker at compile time which checks for correctness of types of variables associates with operations.
3. _Creating implementation machines for evaluator (thus completing the language)_ <br>
    [More](./Assignment%205/README.md)
    - Implement **SECD** and **Krivine** machines for compiling and evaluating programs with *Call by value* or *Call by name* mechanism.
    - Add new constructs such as *recursion, while-loops* e.t.c.
3. _Implementations of the (static/lexical) scoping discipline in Algol-like languages_ <br>
    [More](./Assignment%206/README.md)
    - Design the procedure-call implementation as in PASCAL on a stack.
    - Implement static and dynamic links with display registers for associated access and call.
